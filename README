This repository contains my additions to Phing see <http://phing.info>
that are not included to Phing, which they hopefully will be at some point.

It mostly contains tasks, a html logger for the time beeing and maybe other
stuff.

In a normal (linux) environment Phing should be installed as a PEAR package and be
located under /usr/share/php/phing. The files in this repo follow the directory
structure from this point on, so for example tasks/ext/SomeTask.php must be copied
to /usr/share/php/phing/tasks/ext/SomeTask.php. Missing directories must be created.
If you path to phing is different I guess you can figure out where to put stuff. ;-)

At the time of this writing the author is using this version of phing: <Phing 2.4.5>
(phing -v on the command line tells me so).

Very probably there are other PEAR packages to be installed (very probably for SVN).
Your phing should tell you about those missing dependencies.
